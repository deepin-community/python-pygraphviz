  * debian/docs:
     - Update for the renamed README.txt file.
  * debian/rules:
     - Clean the pygraphviz.egg-info directory in a “clean::” target since
       it gets generated again during the build, with different contents

     - Not needed, since the license of miles.dat has been sorted out.
     - Drop README.Debian accordingly.
     - Drop version mangling in the watch file accordingly.
     - Drop no longer needed DEB_REAL_UPSTREAM_VERSION variable, and
       use DEB_UPSTREAM_VERSION instead.
  * Ship doc/examples/miles.dat.gz:
     - Add patch to ship it (upstream uses a wildcard on “*.dat” only,
       adding a wildcard on “*.txt.gz”): 10_ship_examples_miles.dat
     - Build-Depends: Add quilt accordingly.
     - debian/rules: Add quilt include accordingly.
  * Graphviz transition:
     - Build-Depends: Replace libgraphviz3-dev with libgraphviz-dev
       (the development package is no longer versioned).
     - Depends: Bump the versioned dependency from >= 2.12 to >= 2.16.

python-pygraphviz (0.35.dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Repack since an example is not DFSG-free: freely distributable but no
    modifications are allowed.
  * Dropped patches (two backports and a patch included upstream):
     + 1_SEGV_backported_fix_r590.diff
     + 2_pkg-config_backported_fix_r605.diff
     + 3_setup.cfg_rpath.diff
  * debian/rules:
     + Commented out the simple-patchsys.mk include accordingly (left there
       until the next need for patches).
     + Dropped DEFAULT_PYTHON, which was used when python-support was still
       unable to handle eggs properly.
     + Replaced DEB_UPSTREAM_VERSION by DEB_REAL_UPSTREAM_VERSION, so as to
       handle the '.dfsg' suffix, due to the repack, since cdbs handles
       DEB_UPSTREAM_VERSION on its own.
     + Dropped DEB_COMPRESS_EXCLUDE since now pygraphviz can handle compressed
       data, and since the example file is the one being removed.
  * debian/watch:
     + Updated, with the addition pygraphviz/ directory.

python-pygraphviz (0.34-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Backported fix (debian/patches/2_pkg-config_backported_fix_r605.diff) from
    r605 since 0.35 is late. Fixed FTBFS with graphviz 2.12, for which the
    output of `pkg-config' changed (no more `-L...'), which pygraphviz didn't
    support (Closes: #423821).
  * Rebuild against graphviz 2.12 (Closes: #425864).
  * Urgency set to `high' since 2 RC bugs are addressed.
  * Build-Depends on libgraphviz3-dev instead of graphviz-dev, and Depends on
    graphviz (>= 2.12) since now it is no longer automatically added to the
    Depends, and since commandline tools are used.
  * Deleted overrides about the rpath, since graphviz no longer uses it.
  * Deleted debian/TODO since this achieves the transition from graphviz 2.8
    to 2.12.
  * Bumped B-D on python-support from 0.5.3 to 0.6.4, since the later is the
    first one to support an appropriate handling of egg directories.
  * Added 3_setup.cfg_rpath.diff to handle the removal of the default
    setup.cfg.

  * New upstream release, including:
     - more tests are available;
     - use threads and temporary files for multiplatform nonblocking IO;
     - django example.
  * Added the Debian Python Modules Team to the Uploaders so that the
    maintenance of the package is ensured.
  * Replaced graphviz by ${shlibs:Depends} in the Depends line.
  * Updated watch file to match the new upstream download area.
  * debian/rules [mostly patch management]:
     - added doc relocation, extraneous license deletion, and Readme.txt to
       README renaming;
     - dropped the appropriate patch accordingly;
     - added a backported patch to fix a SEGV with python2.5 on 64-bit arch,
       from upstream revision r590: 1_SEGV_backported_fix_r590.diff;
     - added the exec permission to all examples, until upstream fixes it.
  * Preparation for graphviz 2.12:
     - added TODO(.Debian) to cover some items needing attention when
       migrating to graphviz 2.12.
  * Python egg:
     - added the --single-version-externally-managed option to
       DEB_PYTHON_INSTALL_ARGS_ALL so that egg-info directories are installed;
     - set DEB_PYTHON_SETUP_CMD to setup_egg.py instead of setup.py, so that
       this option is handled appropriately;
     - hack a bit with a copy+removal of the egg dirs since python-support
       seems not to move them on its own;
     - added a build dependency on python-setuptools and pkg-config
       accordingly.
  * Add XS-Vcs-Svn and XS-Vcs-Browser fields in the control file.
  * Updated lintian override for python2.5.
  * Adjusted copyright years in debian/copyright.

python-pygraphviz (0.32-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Prospective work, not released due to a licensing problem in a
    swig-generated file.
  * Thanks to Einar Ryeng <einarr@pvv.org> for his initial work on the
    packaging, and to Piotr Ozarowski for his debugging skills.
  * Included a lintian override:
     - for the tests/test.py which is not set executable, which is not really
       a matter anyway;
     - about the rpath used to workaround the graphviz-dev issue reported in
       #360968, #312533, and #343476.
  * Added a patch to workaround the broken `nop' from the graphviz package,
    since #359870 is not fixed in Debian right now. Taken from the upstream
    changeset #428: https://networkx.lanl.gov/changeset/428 (thanks to Aric
